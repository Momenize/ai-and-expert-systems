## Hi!

This is my codes and projects for my Artifical Intelligence and Expert Systems Study at Vali-e Asr University of Rafsanjan (VRU)<br />
Professor: PhD. Mohsen Haj Abdollahi<br />
Winter-Spring 2025


## First of All
Yes, I do used chatbots for implementing as it's obvious if you look up the code. That's because I'm not too skilled in python.
