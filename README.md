## Hi!

These are my codes and projects for my Artifical Intelligence and Expert Systems Study at Vali-e Asr University of Rafsanjan (VRU)<br />
Professor: PhD. Mohsen Haj Abdollahi<br />
Winter-Spring 2025


## First of All
These are my first steps on a journey of learning python and more important than that, learning the basics of artificial intelligence, genetic algorithm and ANN. If you look up the code, you'd probably think what an idiot this dude is, his code's crap, etc. but the thing you're not considering is that I dived into ai with no previous experience with none of this shit and I didn't even know the syntax of python. So drink a coffee and relax. And, it'd be better if you could help me get better at this.
For sine project, I definitely used chatbots to get the thing done for me, but I'm happy to announce that the whole circuit project is man-made and I did everything myself; which, the way I see it, counts as a victory, somewhat.
