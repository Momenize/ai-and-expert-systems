## Circuit
In this project, we generate a random truth table with 4 inputs and the goal is to come up with a logic circuit that gives us the same truth table as its output.
### How things work
First of all, we generate our initial population of random chromosomes. Each chromosome contains a 4 * 4 table of genes.<br />
Each gene then contains 2 inputs, a logic gate and the gate's output. The mentioned inputs and output are lists of bits, each containing 16 single bits (0 or 1)
